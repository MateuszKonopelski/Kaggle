# Kaggle
*Kaggle is the most popular website hosting competitions for data scientists. This repository contains code and files which I developed for running and finished competitions mostly for learning purpose. While there are solutions, hints and hacks online (especially for older ones), I decided not to use them and work on my code independly. Only after I finished and upload all predictions, I use others solutions to learn new methods or understand where could I improve.*
